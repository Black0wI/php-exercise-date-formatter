# Date Formatter

For this PHP code exercise, create a file named `date_formatter.php`. This file should contain a function named `date_formatter()` which accepts one parameter. This parameter *should* be a string in `year-month-day` format. 

If the string is not in this format or not a valid date, `date_formatter()` should return an empty string.

If the string is in the correct format, `date_formatter()` should return a string with the date in `Day, Month nth Year` format. For example, given `2016-01-14`, `date_formatter()` would return `Thursday, January 14th 2016`.
